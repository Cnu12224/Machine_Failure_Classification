# 🏭 Machine Failure Classification – Predictive Maintenance Project

This project aims to predict machine failures using operational settings and sensor measurements. It applies classification algorithms to detect failures proactively, helping in predictive maintenance and minimizing downtime.

## 🔍 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling imbalanced classes (if applicable)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training using classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix, accuracy, and F1 score

## 📚 Dataset

- The dataset consists of telemetry and operational data from industrial machines.
- Each record includes multiple sensor readings and a failure label.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cnu12224/Machine_Failure_Classification.git
   cd Machine_Failure_Classification
